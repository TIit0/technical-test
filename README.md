# Tech test


s small develpment challenge i did when i was applying

## Process:

1. Just a challenge I did with next js.


- All i was given was a Json, from the placeholder api. the one with 10 users, so i had to build a site out of that


2. time limit

- I had a time limit to build this, so i had to get it done within two hours.
it was not so bad actually it was pretty manageable 


thanks for reading!
